## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - Vue.js Framework

### What I learned

- learnt how to manipulate the DOM in real-time.
- learnt form validation with Vue.js.
-  learnt how to implement animation on page load.

### Continued development

I want to add responsiveness for all device sizes.
I would like to add spacing in the input fields.

### Useful resources

- [Vue.js Documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html) - This helped me get a better understanding of Vue. I learnt concepts which I was not aware of prior, which helped me complete this project more efficiently. Taking full advantage of the framework.
